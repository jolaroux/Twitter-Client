This is a Twitter client that enables pro-level features normally hidden behind paid services. 

Written in ReactJS and Node, and runs on Electron.
Also has Babel, Webpack, Webpack-Dev-Server for easier dev. 

This software enables:
- Auto Direct Messages 
- Mass Direct Messaging
- Tweet Draft Saving 
- Exporting followers of a given twitter account 
- Mass following said followers for your account
- Downloading Videos from given tweets

However, as of 2018, Twitter has deprecated these APIs so many features of this software no longer work.
Thanks for your interest.
